# A* Algorithm in a Game (ASTAR-Game)

In this game implementation, we utilize the A* algorithm, also known as A star, to showcase how it operates effectively in finding the best path from point A to point B on a graph or grid-based map.

## Understanding the A* Algorithm

The A* algorithm is a fundamental tool in computer science and artificial intelligence, designed for identifying the most optimal path between two points, namely A and B, on a graph or a grid-based map.

One of the remarkable strengths of the A* algorithm lies in its ability to efficiently find the shortest and fastest route to reach the destination point, B. To achieve this, the algorithm incorporates a heuristic function, which provides an estimation of the cost from the current node to the goal node. Additionally, it considers the actual cost of reaching that particular node from the starting point, A. By cleverly balancing these two factors, the A* algorithm skillfully navigates its search, ensuring a streamlined and effective path towards the ultimate goal, B.
